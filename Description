The Travel FAQ Chatbot is a tourism assistant built using Python and Streamlit that provides instant, reliable travel information for international travelers. 
The chatbot can answer questions about visa requirements, vaccination guidelines, currency exchange rates, local customs, emergency contacts, and travel insurance for multiple destinations. 
It detects user intent, retrieves the most relevant travel data, and generates natural language responses that can be translated into multiple languages, making it accessible to a global audience. 
This project demonstrates how interactive chatbots can reduce customer support workload, deliver real-time travel assistance, and improve traveler experience through scalable and cost-efficient automation.
